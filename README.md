# React JSX Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice defining components' appearance with JSX
2. Practice compiling JavaScript

## Overview

This is where the pedal hits the metal. Students will need to build out a simple
application themselves, compiling and rendering everything with browserify.

This will probably be a difficult lab; feel free to give students some hints. We
mainly want to make sure that they know there's no magic here â€” it's just
scripts.
